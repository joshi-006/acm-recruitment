## Daily Progress

| Day | Task Summary |
|-----|--------------|
| *Day 1* | Performed basic data cleaning and exploratory data analysis (EDA) on a burnout dataset by handling the  missing values,fixing the outliners,datavisualization . |
| *Day 2* | Applied preprocessing techniques for machine learning. Encoded categorical variables using OneHotEncoder,OrdinalEncoder and combined them with scaled numerical features to prepare the dataset for modeling. Performed Regression like Linear,Lasso and Ridge to decide which is best among three the types. |
